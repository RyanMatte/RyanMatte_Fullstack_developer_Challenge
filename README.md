# RyanMatte_Fullstack_developer_Challenge

This is my attempt at the Fullstack developer challenge for prepr

Deplyment Instructions: 

The technologies used are bootstrap, html, css, mySQL and PHP.
The webserver technology used for this program was wampserver.
Clone this into your www directory on wamp server and navigate to the location from localhost to use the website

The application above utilizes a mySQL database in order to allow for database access as well modularity of the system. 
The purpose of implementing it this way is to allow for my code to be upgraded in the future, as well as to include that data from the spreadsheet that may be used in a future update
I utilize PHP with the webserver and database in order to interact within pages as well as within the server.

For the front end of the website my focus was on maintaining the design seen in prepr's website as well as having a seamless and easy to understand UI. By utilizing bootstrap with my css and html code, I was able to develop a website that is not only easy to use, but similar to the design principles seen in prepr's other websites. I have also setup the website to dynamically add elements to the page using php, as well as added a format that can allow future developments of the webpage to maintain a set standard. 

I added the registration as well as admin pages in order to create a more realistic website that can be expanded upon. By allowing for multiple users as well as the addition of new labs, the website can continue to be used without the addition of hardcoding new elements, but allowing users to dynamically manipulate elements on the page. I have utilized the google api in 2 ways. The first is querying the api to find a location on a map. This can be seen in my results page once a user selects a lab. I also use the geolocation api from google in order to update the coordinates if an admin user wishes to update the address of a lab. I believe that this website shows an understanding of fullstack design principles and also shows careful coding that is modular and expandable.

Thank you for your time and consideration
